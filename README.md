# YelpCamp-Deploy-Trio-Local-Container-Azure
YelpCamp Deploy Trio is a comprehensive DevOps project demonstrating the deployment of the YelpCamp application across various environments. The project includes setting up a three-tier deployment process covering local, containerized, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environments.

## Introduction

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application designed for campground reviews. YelpCamp Deploy Trio project focuses on setting up a robust deployment pipeline for YelpCamp, ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability across different environments. 

## Features

- **Local Deployment:** Allows developers to test the application locally before pushing changes to other environments.
- **Container Deployment:** Utilizes Docker containers for development and testing, incorporating Jenkins pipelines for automated builds, tests, and scans.
- **Azure AKS Deployment:** Automates deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for production-level environments, ensuring seamless scalability and reliability.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Docker:** Containerization platform used for packaging the application and its dependencies.
- **Jenkins:** Automation server used for setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **GitHub:** Version control system used for managing project source code and collaboration.
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **SonarQube:** Open-source platform for static code analysis to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- **Trivy:** Vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts, used for scanning Docker images.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

## Real-World Scenario

YelpCamp Deploy Trio project simulates real-world deployment scenarios, providing a comprehensive solution for deploying web applications across various environments. What sets this project apart is its focus on:

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Integration of testing, code analysis, and vulnerability scanning in the deployment pipeline ensures high-quality deployments.
- **Scalability:** Utilizing Azure AKS for deployment enables seamless scaling of the application based on demand.
- **End-to-End Automation:** The project automates the entire deployment process from code commit to production deployment, reducing manual errors and enhancing efficiency.
- **Media Management:** Integration with Cloudinary to streamline media management and improve user experience by automatically delivering images and videos, enhanced and optimized for every user.
- **Maps Integration:** Integration with Mapbox, a provider of custom online maps for websites and applications, enhancing the user experience with interactive maps.
