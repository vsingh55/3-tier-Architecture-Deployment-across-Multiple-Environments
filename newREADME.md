## 🚀 Project Overview
YelpCamp is a comprehensive web application for campground reviews, demonstrating a robust, scalable deployment strategy across multiple environments.

### Project Objectives
- Implement a modular three-tier architecture
- Enable consistent deployment across local, containerized, and cloud environments
- Showcase advanced DevOps practices and tools

## ✨ Key Features
### Environment Deployment Strategies
- **Local Development Environment**
  - Supports rapid local testing and iteration
  - Simplified development workflow
  - Easy debugging capabilities

- **Containerized Deployment**
  - Docker-based application packaging
  - Automated build and testing processes
  - Comprehensive vulnerability scanning

- **Cloud-Native Kubernetes Deployment**
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) integration
  - Scalable and reliable production infrastructure
  - Seamless cloud deployment

### Architectural Components
- **Frontend Tier**: User interface and client-side logic
- **Backend Tier**: Application server and business logic
- **Database Tier**: Data persistence and storage
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment
- **Monitoring Layer**: Performance and health tracking

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Terraform
- Docker
- Azure CLI
- kubectl
- Jenkins
- Cloud Platform Account

## 📦 Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vsingh55/3-tier-Architecture-Deployment-across-Multiple-Environments.git
cd project-directory
```

### 2. Infrastructure Provisioning
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform workspace new dev
terraform apply -var-file=dev.auto.tfvars
```

### 3. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration
- Install required Jenkins plugins
- Configure credentials for:
  * Docker Hub
  * SonarQube
  * Kubernetes
- Create pipeline using provided Jenkinsfile

### 4. Application Deployment
```bash
kubectl create namespace webapps
# Trigger Jenkins deployment pipeline
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Secure credential management
- Network security configuration
- Least privilege access principles

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting
- Verify network configurations
- Check credential permissions
- Review Jenkins pipeline logs
- Validate Terraform state
